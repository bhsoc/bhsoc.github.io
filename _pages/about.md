Hi! I am a dual-title Ph.D. candidate in [Sociology](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/sociology/index.html) and [Gerontology](https://www.purdue.edu/aging/dualtitle/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I am affiliated with the [Center on Aging and the Life Course](https://www.purdue.edu/aging/about/), [The Methodology Center at Purdue](https://www.purdue.edu/research/mcap/), and the [Joe and Maggie Kernan Experimental Social Science Lab](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/sociology/research/labs/joe-and-maggie-kernan-experimental-social-science-lab/index.html). I am advised by [Dr. Trenton Mize](https://www.trentonmize.com) and [Dr. Shawn Bauldry](https://sites.google.com/site/sgbauldry/).

My research and education span sociology, gerontology, statistics, and geography, with a strong interdisciplinary foundation in the social and behavioral sciences. I specialize in advanced quantitative methods, computational techniques, experimental design, and spatial analysis. Substantively, drawing on theories of health lifestyles, the stigmatization process, and stereotyping, I investigate how health behaviors are socially constructed and how stigma and stereotypes develop around diverse health lifestyles across the life course. I also examine how built environments—such as neighborhood amenities and green spaces—shape older adults’ well-being and cognitive functioning. Methodologically, I employ a wide range of approaches, including machine learning, categorical data analysis, longitudinal modeling, latent variable analysis, experiments, and mixed methods. I also develop statistical tools to enhance the measurement and interpretation of nominal variables.

Feel free to reach out at [han644@purdue.edu](mailto:han644@purdue.edu). I welcome opportunities for collaboration, discussion, and connection.
